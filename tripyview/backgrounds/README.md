credits: ETOPO1 is a 1 arc-minute global relief model of Earth's surface that 
         integrates land topography and ocean bathymetry. Built from global 
         and regional data sets, it is available in "Ice Surface" (top of 
         Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets) and "Bedrock" (base of the ice 
         sheets). ETOPO1 Global Relief Model is used to calculate the Volumes 
         of the World's Oceans and to derive a Hypsographic Curve of Earth's Surface.
